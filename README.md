What is a life without joy?

Well that's a great question. But we have to answer to a another question, are we happy?

I mean of course we are happy, I am happy... I am... dad is happy, mom is happy, but are they?

Is happiness that obvious? Do my dad is happy in his work? Do my mom is happy with her husband? Do I really am happy as I can be? Is this a life?

Is a life a life without him? Is a life a life with this pression, with this need of freedom?
